# Data-Driven-Job-Market-Analysis-for-Student-and-Alumni-Career-Assistance
This project aims to develop an automated job market analysis and job assistance system using web scraping and data analytics to help students and alumni make informed career decisions. The system collects real-time job postings from Naukri.com using Python and Selenium, extracting key information such as job title, company name, company ratings, required skills, experience range, job location, salary details, and posting date across multiple pages.

Since job portal data is highly unstructured, the scraped data is cleaned and transformed using pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and mixed text–numeric fields. The processed dataset is stored in CSV format for further analysis and reuse. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations are performed to identify job market trends, including high-demand roles, major hiring locations, experience-level requirements, salary patterns, and employer ratings.

To strengthen the analytical depth of the project, statistical hypothesis testing using one-way ANOVA is applied to evaluate whether company ratings significantly differ across experience groups. The results provide data-driven insights rather than assumptions, enabling a better understanding of employer quality and job market behavior.

This project also addresses real-world web scraping challenges such as dynamic content loading, pagination, and changing class names by implementing explicit waits, fallback selectors, and card-based extraction logic. Overall, the project demonstrates the practical application of web scraping, data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to transform raw job listings into meaningful career intelligence, supporting effective job search and career planning for students and alumni.
